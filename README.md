# Tengai Frontend Code Challenge
You've found to this place are you're about to your code challenge for Tengai.

Dont worry, it's not as dramatic as you think.

In this repo are two code-bases.
* One for React
* One for Vue

Pick which one you'd like.  

  
##  Note
The code-bases are in strict Typescript + ESLint rules, meaning we're enforcing a set of rules that might feel weird and strange at first.
The background is in the assignment brief you should've recieved.

You can ofcourse choose the web frontend tools you'd like as long as it's written in Typescript and has our TS + ESLint rules.
Why? That's the syntax we use at Tengai.


## Maximum 2 hours.
Don't feel discouraged if you don't make it on time. We're not after the end result of the assignment but rather the thinking and reasoning behind your descisions. Let us know what trade-offs you made and insights you've gained with this assignment.
